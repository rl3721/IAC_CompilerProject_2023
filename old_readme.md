## Some random code discovered that should be made illegalï¼š

* should return 2: done but ugly
``` 
int main(){
    int x = 1;
    {
        x = 2;
        int x;
        x = 3;
    }
    return x;
}
```

* should return 2, not done
``` 
int main(){
    int x = 3;
    switch{
        case 0:
            return 0;
        default:
        case 9999:
            return 2;
    }
}
```
